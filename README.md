# Gergely Sajo Portfolio Website

## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to show my projects I made for different uses, built with different technologies.

## Functionalities
### Sticky Site Header
When users scroll the site header and its content shrinks and moves up to the top. Once the users are scrolled all the way to the top the site header and its content goes back to normal size.

### Animated Mobile Menu Icon X
When seeing the website from a mobile device the hamburger menu icon can be seen. Once its opened it turns into an "X" and the mobile menu opens. When the "X" is clicked the mobile menu disappears and the hamburger menu icon appears again.

### Responsive Mobile First Design
The CSS rules were created by bearing in mind the mobile first responsive design.

### Contact Form
At the bottom of the website a Contact from can be seen, in which an emailing function is implemented with Formspree.

## Stack
### Languages
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* React.js
* Formspree

I did not use any CSS of JS libraries to make the website, only for icons.
I used Formspree for the contact form to be able to forward the emails to my email address.

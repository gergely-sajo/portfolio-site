          My full name is Gergely Sajo, but just call me Gary. I am a self-taught developer located in Vienna, Austria. Currently, I am pursuing the opportunity to begin my career in web development.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The started getting into web development by wanting to create a website for myself, and wanted to know how web technologies work in detail, so I started a course about web development.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          One course led to another and then another and so on...
